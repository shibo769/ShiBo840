#	Understanding that when we sort on the basis of estimates
#	we necessarily sort (partially) on the basis of realized
#	estimation errors.


# Sorting stocks on the basis of estimated parameters
# is routinely done in quant. finance
#	academics test anomalies
#	practitioners test trading rules or portfolio strategies


#  SORTING STOCKS ON ESTIMATEs of BETA
#  after the market model regression
freq <- 12
mum  <- 0.08/freq			# Typical Risk Premium
sigm <- 0.15/sqrt(freq)		# Typical Market std. dev.
sigstock<- 0.25/sqrt(freq)	# Typical Stock Standard Deviation

nyear <- 1
TT    <- nyear*freq				

beta <- 1
Rsq <- (beta*sigm / sigstock)^2 	# Typical R-square
Rsq

vareps <- sigstock^2 * (1-Rsq)
sqrt(vareps)		# Typical residual std. dev. of a regression

# var(beta_hat) = sigeps^2 / (TT*var(Rm-Rf))	

sigbeta<- sqrt(vareps / (TT*sigm^2) )
sigbeta

# Simulate beta_hats and sort them

nstocks<-2000
betavec<-sort(rnorm(nstocks,1,sigbeta))		# Remember, True betas are all 1

hist(betavec,nclass=50,prob=T,main="");box()
title("Estimated betas for T=104, if true betas are all 1")

# Now make portfolios on the basis of beta-hat
# Why do we make portfolios?

npor <- 40
spp  <-nstocks/npor;  spp		# stocks per portfolios

#
# If the beta-hats are NOT correlated across stocks
# By how much did we reduce the variance of beta-hat
# If there are N stocks in the portfolio
# 	v(betaport-hat) = (1/N^2) * (N v(betastock-hat))
#
# How do we compute this if they are correlated
#		Use the SUR formula !

sigbetport<-sigbeta / sqrt(spp)
sigbetport

# So the portfolio betas will be much more precisely estimated
# than the stock betas

# Make the portfolios
# And Look at their estimated betas

betaport<-rep(0,npor)
for (i in 1:npor){
	ibeg<-(1+(i-1)*spp)
	iend<-(spp+(i-1)*spp)
	betaport[i]<-mean(betavec[ibeg:iend])
	}

round(betaport,2)

# We sorted on the basis of estimation errors!

# What will happen if we use these betas on the right hand side of 
# the second pass cross-sectional regression

# ... Or to optimize a portfolio subject to a beta target.

# Remedy?
	#	shrink the estimates .... shrinkage or bayesian estimation
	#	or ... re-estimate the betas.
